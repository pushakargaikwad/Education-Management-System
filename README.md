# Education Management System
## What is it?
Open Source Education Management System modules based on top of Odoo. It can be used in schools, colleges, universities, coaching institutes etc. 
## Installation
- Each Module has its own separate folder, and can be installed separately.
- Installation Steps are the same as for any standard Odoo Custom module
- Some modules have dependencies on other modules that are from other repositories. If you are installing from Odoo App Store it will be automatically installed. But if you are manually installing it will be required to install the dependencies. More information can be found in the README.md file of each module.

## Note WIP ðŸš§
Please note this repository is WIP. You can however start using the modules. You can also contribute to the development of the modules.
The original Education Management System was developed on top of OpenERP 7 and Odoo 8. While those systems have been successfully used in multiple institutes, it is now time to upgrade to Odoo 15 and beyond. 
All the modules are being completely rewritten and optimised with the experience of past few years of working with Educational Institutes. 
Odoo 15.0 is being used as the base version for development.
